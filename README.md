# SparkPost PHP SDK
The official PHP binding for your favorite SparkPost APIs!

Before using this library, you must have a valid API Key.

To get an API Key, please log in to your SparkPost account and generate one in the Settings page.

## Installation
The recommended way to install the SparkPost PHP SDK is through composer.
```

After installing, you need to require Composer's autoloader:
```
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

## Getting Started:  Your First Mailing
```
SparkPost::setConfig(["key"=>"YOUR API KEY"]);

try {
	// Build your email and send it!
	Transmission::send(array('campaign'=>'first-mailing', 
		'from'=>'you@your-company.com',
	    'subject'=>'First SDK Mailing',
	    'html'=>'<html><body><h1>Congratulations, {{name}}!</h1><p>You just sent your very first mailing!</p></body></html>',
	    'text'=>'Congratulations, {{name}}!! You just sent your very first mailing!',
	    'substitutionData'=>array('name'=>'YOUR FIRST NAME'),
	    'recipients'=>array(array('address'=>array('name'=>'YOUR FULL NAME', 'email'=>'YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS' )))
    ));

    echo 'Woohoo! You just sent your first mailing!';
} catch (Exception $err) {
    echo 'Whoops! Something went wrong';
    var_dump($err);
}

## Tips and Tricks
### General
* You _must_ provide at least an API key when instantiating the SparkPost Library - `[ 'key'=>'184ac5480cfdd2bb2859e4476d2e5b1d2bad079bf' ]`
* The SDK's features are namespaced under the various SparkPost API names.

### Transmissions
* If you specify a stored recipient list and inline recipients in a Transmission, you will recieve an error.
* If you specify HTML and/or Plain Text content and then provide RFC-822 encoded content, you will receive an error.
    * RFC-822 content is not valid with any other content type.
* If you specify a stored template and also provide inline content via `html` or `text`, you will receive an error.
* By default, open and click tracking are enabled for a transmission.
* By default, a transmission will use the published version of a stored template.

## Development

### Setup
Run `composer install` inside the directory to install dependecies and development tools.

### Testing
Once all the dependencies are installed, you can execute the unit tests using `vendor/bin/phpunit --bootstrap test/unit/bootstrap.php ./test/unit`.

If you're interested in code coverage, you can add the `--coverage` flag for phpunit like so: ```phpunit --coverage-html test/output/report --bootstrap test/unit/bootstrap.php ./test/unit```
