# SparkPost PHP Library

[![Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/SparkPost/php-sparkpost.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SparkPost/php-sparkpost)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/SparkPost/php-sparkpost/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/SparkPost/php-sparkpost?branch=master) [![Slack Status](http://slack.sparkpost.com/badge.svg)](http://slack.sparkpost.com)

The official PHP library for using [the SparkPost REST API](https://developers.sparkpost.com/api/).

Before using this library, you must have a valid API Key. To get an API Key, please log in to your SparkPost account and generate one in the Settings page.

## Installation
The recommended way to install the SparkPost PHP Library is through composer.

```
# Install Composer
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

Next, run the Composer command to install the SparkPost PHP Library:
###### Please note: The composer package `sparkpost/php-sparkpost` has been abandoned in favor of `sparkpost/sparkpost`

```
composer require sparkpost/sparkpost
```

After installing, you need to require Composer's autoloader:

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
use SparkPost\SparkPost;
```

## Setting up a Request Adapter

Because of dependency collision, we have opted to use a request adapter rather than
requiring a request library.  This means that your application will need to pass in
a request adapter to the constructor of the SparkPost Library.  We use the [HTTPlug](https://github.com/php-http/httplug) in SparkPost. Please visit their repo for a list of supported adapters.  If you don't currently use a request library, you will
need to require one and create an adapter from it and pass it along. The example below uses the GuzzleHttp Client Library.

An Adapter can be setup like so:

```php
<?php
use SparkPost\SparkPost;
use GuzzleHttp\Client;
use Http\Adapter\Guzzle6\Client as GuzzleAdapter;

$httpClient = new GuzzleAdapter(new Client());
$sparky = new SparkPost($httpClient, ['key'=>'YOUR_API_KEY']);
?>
```

## Examples

### Send An Email Using The Transmissions Endpoint
```php
<?php
use SparkPost\SparkPost;
use GuzzleHttp\Client;
use Http\Adapter\Guzzle6\Client as GuzzleAdapter;

$httpClient = new GuzzleAdapter(new Client());
$sparky = new SparkPost($httpClient, ['key'=>'YOUR_API_KEY']);

$promise = $sparky->transmissions->post([
    'content' => [
        'from'=> [
            'name' => 'Sparkpost Team',
            'email' => 'from@sparkpostbox.com'
        ],
        'subject'=>'First Mailing From PHP',
        'html'=>'<html><body><h1>Congratulations, {{name}}!</h1><p>You just sent your very first mailing!</p></body></html>',
        'text'=>'Congratulations, {{name}}!! You just sent your very first mailing!'
    ],
    'substitution_data'=> ['name'=>'YOUR_FIRST_NAME'],
    'recipients'=> [
        [ 'address' => '<YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS>' ]
    ],
    'bcc' =>  [
        ['address' => '<ANOTHER_EMAIL_ADDRESS>' ]
    ]
]);
?>
```

### Send An API Call Using The Base Request Function
We may not wrap every resource available in the SparkPost Client Library, for example the PHP Client Library does not wrap the Metrics resource. To allow you to use the full power of our API we created the `request` function which allows you to access the unwrapped resources.
```php
<?php
use SparkPost\SparkPost;
use GuzzleHttp\Client;
use Http\Adapter\Guzzle6\Client as GuzzleAdapter;

$httpClient = new GuzzleAdapter(new Client());
$sparky = new SparkPost($httpClient, ['key'=>'YOUR_API_KEY']);

$promise = $sparky->request('GET', 'metrics/ip-pools', [
    'from' => '2015-12-01T08:00',
    'to' => '2014-12-01T09:00',
    'timezone' => 'America/New_York',
    'limit' => '5'
]);
?>
```


## Handling Responses
The all API calls return a promise. You can wait for the promise to be fulfilled or you can handle it asynchronously.

##### Wait (Synchronous)
```php
<?php
try {
    $response = $promise->wait();
    echo $response->getStatusCode();
    echo $response->getBody();
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo $e->getCode();
    echo $e->getMessage();
}
?>
```

##### Then (Asynchronous)
```php
<?php
$promise->then(
    // Success callback
    function ($response) {
        echo $response->getStatusCode();
        echo $response->getBody();
    },
    // Failure callback
    function (Exception $e) {
        echo $e->getCode();
        echo $e->getMessage();
    }
);
?>
```

## Handling Exceptions
The promise will throw an exception if the server returns a status code of `400` or higher.

### Exception
* **getCode()**
    * Returns the response status code of `400` or higher
* **getMessage()**
    * Returns the body of response as an `Array`
